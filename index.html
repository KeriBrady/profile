            <p>In every job I’ve held so far &ndash; from Quiznos sandwich artist to retail management to social media marketing &ndash; I’ve always been the happiest when I’m learning. I also love working with like-minded people and collaborating on new and exciting ideas; the feeling of a huge breakthrough after hours of teamwork is exhilarating and I can’t get enough of it.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I unwind in more solitary ways. Curling up and getting lost in a good book, going for a walk and exploring somewhere new, and catching up with family or friends one-on-one are some of my preferred activities.</p>

              <p>I graduated from Western Washington University in 2012 with a Bachelors Degree in Communication and minors in Psychology and Internet Resource Creation and Management. It was here that I discovered my love for communication, especially visual communication, and front-end web development, and was fortunate enough to be able to explore each of those interests.</p>

              <h1>Retail Management</h1>
              <p>Throughout college and for almost a year after graduating, I worked in retail management at Hollister Co., then Paper Source. I learned a lot about myself and what I wanted to do in these roles. I thoroughly enjoyed the team aspect of running the stores and helping coworkers do well from my position in management, but wasn’t sure I wanted to move forward in that industry.</p>

              <h1>Marketing</h1>
              <p>After Paper Source, I worked in the Marketing department of Smartsheet.com, a tech company located in Bellevue, Washington. Working with a dynamic, driven team was an exciting challenge, and I pushed myself in that role to work on new types of projects with various departments across the company. While I loved the team I was working with, I knew I wanted to be doing a different kind of work &ndash; which is why I decided to go back to school in January 2015.</p>

              <h1>Web UI Dev</h1>
              <p>I already knew I really enjoyed front-end development work, which is how I ended up at Code Fellows in Seattle. I recently concluded their 4-week Computer Science and Web Development Bootcamp, where I completed multiple projects in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and worked with industry standard development tools. Now with a solid foundation, I’m aiming to move on to the Web UI Accelerator, an 8-week program that goes deep into UI development concepts and will prepare me for my future career.</p>

              <h1>Future Plans</h1>
              <p>Once I graduate from Code Fellows, my goal is to land a UI Development job with a company or startup in the Seattle area. My dream job would include a driven, smart, supportive team to work with, the opportunity to learn new skills, a positive and innovative work environment, and the feeling of being eager to go to work and build things every day. It’s a tall order, but one I’m so excited to pursue.</p>
